Implementation of YoloV3 OpenCV Code to inference an image and give results

Steps:

1. Importing all necessary Packages like Opencv, numpy etc.
2. Loading YoloV3 weights, CFG and Class names.
3. Reading an Own Image and retrieving Annotated image by OpenCV Yolo Interference
4. Inferencing the image and giving results as class names. 
5. 2 Images taken as examples here 
        1. Working room - class names are Chair, TV Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse
        2. Furniture (Drawing Hall) - Dining Table, Potted Plant, Sofa, Cup
